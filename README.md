In this assignment your computer will say hello to you. Before this can happen you have to write some code.

First write code for running the application (hint: this includes handling the `public static void main(String[] args)` function).

Next ask the user what their name is.

Finally, say hello.

For example:

```
$ java -cp . Hello
What is your name?
Jeff
Hello Jeff
```

Once you've completed your program, you can commit and push your changes to GitHub. This will automatically try to run the program and make sure it works.

Good luck!
